# üß† Natural Language Classification: Quora Insincere Questions

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to classify questions from the Quora Insincere Questions Classification challenge using the Bag of Words (BoW) technique and traditional machine learning methods.

The goal is to detect toxic or insincere questions that could undermine constructive discourse on the platform.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The project is divided into the following main steps:

- Download and Explore the Data

- Text Preprocessing

- Feature Engineering using Bag of Words

- Model Training and Evaluation

- Prediction and Submission to Kaggle

### üì• 1. Data Download and Exploration

Dataset downloaded using the Kaggle API and stored in a data/ directory.

Files used:

- train.csv ‚Äì training data

- test.csv ‚Äì test data

- sample_submission.csv ‚Äì sample submission format

#### Explore the Data Using Pandas

train_fname = 'data/train.csv.zip'
raw_df = pd.read_csv(train_fname)

ax.set_xlabel('Question Type (0 = Sincere, 1 = Insincere)', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('Proportion', fontsize=12)

### üßπ Apply Text Preprocessing Techniques

Outline:
- Understanding the Bag of Words Model
- Tokenization
- Stop Words removal
- Stemming

#### Bag of words intuition

- Create a list of all the words across all the text document.

- Convert each document (Question) in to a vector containing the counts of each word.

#### Limitations

- There may be too many words in the dataset - The vector may not fit in the memory

- Some words may occure too frequentlly

- Some words may occure vey rarely or only once - It may not give enough information the calassify the word appropriately

A single word may have many forms (go,gone,going bird vs birds)

### üßÆ Implement the Bag of Words Model

Outline:

- Create a vocabulary using Count Vectorizer

- Transform text to Vectors using Count Vectorizer

- Configure text Preprocessing in Count Vectorizer

### ü§ñ Train ML Model for Classification

- Create a training and validation set
  
- Train a logistic regression model
  
- Make predictions on training, validation and test data.

### üì§ Make Predictions and Submit to Kaggle
